## A library providing techniques for local interpretation of machine learning models.

This library will provide ways to local explain machine learning models like random forests, 
neural networks, etc. Every is model-specific and local-based. Currently there are two approaches:

1. LioNets: Local Interpretation Of Neural nETworkS through penultimate layer decoding
2. LionForests: Local Interpretation Of raNdom FORESts through paTh Selection
