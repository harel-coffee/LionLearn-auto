Building interpretable random forests!

Towards a future where machine learning systems willintegrate into every aspect of people’s lives, researching methods tointerpret such systems is necessary, instead of focusing exclusivelyon enhancing their performance. Enriching the trust between thesesystems  and  people  will  accelerate  this  integration  process.  Manymedical and retail banking/finance applications use state-of-the-artmachine  learning  techniques  to  predict  certain  aspects  of  new  in-stances. Tree ensembles, like random forests, are widely acceptablesolutions on these tasks, while at the same time they are avoided dueto their black-box uninterpretable nature, creating an unreasonableparadox. In this paper, we provide a sequence of actions for shed-ding light on the predictions of the misjudged family of tree ensem-ble algorithms. Using classic unsupervised learning techniques andan enhanced similarity metric, to wander among transparent trees in-side a forestfollowing breadcrumbs, the interpretable essence of treeensembles arises. An explanation provided by these systems usingour approach, which we call “LionForests”, can be a simple, com-prehensive rule.
